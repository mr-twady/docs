# Introduction

The principle of multi tenancy is about a single instance of software running
on a server and serving multiple tenants. The interpretation of such a tenancy
application is quite diverse.

Hyn tenancy is focused on providing a drop-in solution for Laravel without
sacrificing flexibility or hacks of the Laravel ecosystem.

Make sure you understand that the `Website` model is the subject of tenancy.

The default method for identifying such a tenant website is by using the requested
domain aka hostname. Taking a URL `http://yourdomain.com/foo/bar` only `yourdomain.com`
is taken into account although modifications to this logic is easy to implement. The
`yourdomain.com` part of the URL is called a Fully Qualified Domain Name or `fqdn` for short.
 
A website can have zero or more hostnames connected to it. This allows for easier
attachment of additional hostnames or serving, for instance, an ad campaign page
on different domains.

# Website

You can think of a website as a single mirror of the code base, re-using your default
app code. In addition it is also possible to have very [tenant specific logic][directory-structure], 
for instance routes, a vendor folder, media and language files.

# Hostname

A hostname is a [Fully Qualified Domain Name][fqdn] (for instance `sub.example.com`).
Your application handles incoming requests to specific hostnames. Tenancy inspects
these requests and [sets up the tenancy environment][identification] according to a 
matching hostname or falls back to the default one.

# Runtime

By default, the package will identify the current requested hostname and bind it
into the `Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\CurrentHostname` contract. In case that hostname belongs to
a website, the latter will be bound into the `Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\Tenant` contract. Whenever
a Tenant is identified or switched, the package will automatically infuse additional functionality
into Laravel, including [global tenant routes][routes], [tenant overrides][directory-structure] 
and [queues][queues].
